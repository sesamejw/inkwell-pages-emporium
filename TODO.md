# ThouArt - Feature Roadmap & Bug Fixes

## 🎮 Lore Chronicles — Interactive Roleplay System

A choose-your-adventure roleplay experience where users create characters and embark on branching story adventures within the ThouArt universe. Stories can intertwine, and users can expand the lore under Loremaster oversight.

### Vision & Goals

- **Immersive storytelling** tied to existing Witness Almanac lore
- **Player agency** through meaningful branching choices
- **Community-driven content** with quality control via Loremasters
- **Scalable architecture** supporting solo, async, and real-time multiplayer

---

### Core Systems

**JSONB Structures:**
- `stats`: `{ "strength": 5, "magic": 3, "charisma": 4, "wisdom": 3, "agility": 5 }`
- `story_flags`: `{ "met_elder": true, "has_relic": false, "reputation_score": 12 }`
- `stat_requirement`: `{ "stat": "charisma", "min_value": 4 }`
- `stat_effect`: `{ "charisma": +1 }` or `{ "unlock_ability": "persuasion" }`

---

### Technical Architecture

#### State Management
- Use **finite state machine** pattern for story progression
- `story_flags` JSONB for tracking narrative state (items, relationships, decisions)
- Snapshot stats at session start for consistency during playthrough

#### Real-Time (Phase 3)
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions on `rp_sessions` for multiplayer sync
- Presence tracking for "who's online" in group sessions
- Optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution

#### Lore Validation (Phase 4)
- Cross-reference proposals against `almanac_*` tables
- Flag potential conflicts (e.g., duplicate location names)
- Automated checks + human Loremaster review

#### Reusable Components
- `AvatarUpload` → Character portrait upload with cropping
- `CharacterComparison` → Adapt for stat visualization
- `DynamicRelationshipMap` → Visualize character connections within campaigns

---

### Advanced Campaign Systems

#### 6. Key Points & Dynamic Pathways
Campaign creators define **Key Points** (major story milestones) — what happens *between* them is driven by the player.

- [x] **Key Point Nodes** — Special high-priority milestone nodes that anchor the narrative arc
- [x] **Dynamic Path Generation** — Between key points, players navigate via:
  - Pre-built response selections (creator-authored choices)
  - Activity-based interactions (mini-challenges, puzzles, trades)
  - Free-text player input (open-ended responses interpreted by game logic)
- [x] **Key Point Branching** — Which key points even occur depends on prior player actions
- [x] **Key Point Editor UI** — Visual editor showing key points as anchors with flexible paths between
- [x] **Path Weighting** — Creator assigns probability/conditions for which paths appear

**Key Point Structure:**
```
[Start] ──→ {dynamic path} ──→ [Key Point A] ──→ {dynamic path} ──→ [Key Point C]
                                      │
                                      └── (if betrayed faction) ──→ [Key Point B] ──→ ...
```

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_key_points` | Major story milestones | `campaign_id`, `title`, `description`, `order_index`, `is_required`, `conditions` (JSONB), `image_url` |
| `rp_key_point_paths` | Connections between key points | `source_key_point_id`, `target_key_point_id`, `path_type` (linear/conditional/random), `conditions` (JSONB) |

#### 7. Event Trigger System
Events require specific **triggers** set by the creator — player actions, stat thresholds, item possession, or time-based conditions.

- [x] **Trigger Definitions** — Creators define triggers on nodes (stat check, item held, flag set, relationship threshold)
- [x] **Trigger Chains** — Multiple triggers can be combined (AND/OR logic)
- [x] **Triggered Events** — When conditions are met, fire events (unlock path, spawn encounter, modify stats)
- [x] **Conditional Visibility** — Choices/paths only appear when triggers are satisfied
- [x] **Trigger Editor UI** — Visual builder for creating trigger conditions in the campaign editor
- [x] **Trigger Log** — Players can see which triggers they've activated (optional transparency)

**Trigger Types:**
| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `stat_threshold` | Strength ≥ 7 |
| `item_possessed` | Has "Ancient Key" |
| `flag_set` | `met_elder = true` |
| `relationship_score` | NPC "Kael" ≥ 50 |
| `faction_reputation` | "Shadow Guild" ≥ 30 |
| `choice_made` | Selected "spare the wolf" at node X |
| `player_count` | ≥ 3 players in session (multiplayer) |
| `random_chance` | 30% probability per visit |

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_event_triggers` | Trigger definitions | `campaign_id`, `name`, `trigger_type`, `conditions` (JSONB), `target_event_id` |
| `rp_triggered_events` | Events fired by triggers | `campaign_id`, `name`, `event_type` (unlock_path/spawn_node/modify_stat/grant_item), `payload` (JSONB) |
| `rp_session_trigger_log` | Per-session trigger history | `session_id`, `trigger_id`, `character_id`, `fired_at`, `context` (JSONB) |

#### 8. Interaction Point System
Character-to-character (and character-to-NPC) interactions that trigger **different progressions** for each participant.

- [x] **Interaction Nodes** — Special node type where two+ characters/NPCs interact
- [x] **Dual Outcomes** — Each interaction produces separate outcomes per participant (one gains, other loses — or both benefit/suffer)
- [x] **Interaction Types** — Dialogue, trade, combat, persuasion, alliance proposal, betrayal
- [x] **Interaction History** — Track all interactions per character pair
- [x] **Creator Outcome Designer** — UI for creators to design good/bad outcomes per interaction
- [x] **Stat-Influenced Interactions** — Interaction results modified by participant stats
- [x] **Cascading Effects** — One interaction's outcome affects future available interactions

**Outcome Matrix Example:**
```
Character A (Charisma 7) meets NPC "Kael" (Persuasion check):
  ├─ Pass: A gains trust (+20 relationship), Kael reveals secret → unlocks Path X
  └─ Fail: A loses trust (-10 relationship), Kael becomes suspicious → triggers guard encounter

Creator designs BOTH branches with full consequences.
```

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_interaction_points` | Interaction definitions | `campaign_id`, `node_id`, `interaction_type`, `participants` (JSONB), `outcomes` (JSONB) |
| `rp_interaction_outcomes` | Outcome templates | `interaction_id`, `participant_role`, `result_type` (good/bad/neutral), `stat_effects` (JSONB), `flag_effects` (JSONB), `narrative_text` |
| `rp_interaction_log` | Session interaction history | `session_id`, `interaction_id`, `participants` (JSONB), `outcome_chosen`, `timestamp` |

#### 9. Random Events System
Creator-defined events that fire when **certain conditions are met** — adding unpredictability and replayability.

- [x] **Random Event Pool** — Creators add events to a pool with activation conditions
- [x] **Condition-Based Triggering** — Events fire based on player state, location, turn count, etc.
- [x] **Probability Weighting** — Each event has a % chance when conditions are met
- [x] **One-Time vs Recurring** — Events can fire once or repeat
- [x] **Random Event Categories** — Encounter, weather, fortune, misfortune, discovery, ambush
- [x] **Random Event Editor** — Drag-and-drop event creation with condition builder
- [x] **Event Cooldowns** — Prevent same random event firing too frequently

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_random_events` | Random event definitions | `campaign_id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `probability`, `conditions` (JSONB), `effects` (JSONB), `is_recurring`, `cooldown_turns` |
| `rp_random_event_log` | When events fired | `session_id`, `event_id`, `character_id`, `fired_at`, `outcome` (JSONB) |

#### 10. Multiplayer Convergence System
Each player starts from a **different campaign beginning** which later merges — resulting in allies or enemies based on prior choices.

- [x] **Multiple Entry Points** — Campaign has 2-4+ distinct starting branches (one per player/faction)
- [x] **Convergence Nodes** — Special nodes where player paths merge
- [x] **Convergence Conditions** — Creators define when/how paths collide (after X key points, specific triggers, etc.)
- [x] **Prior Choice Impact** — Players' decisions before convergence determine their relationship at meeting
- [x] **Alliance/Enemy Resolution** — Automatic determination: allies, enemies, or neutral based on faction, flags, and choices
- [x] **Post-Convergence Branching** — Story continues differently for allied vs enemy player groups
- [x] **Convergence Reveal UI** — Dramatic reveal moment when players discover each other's histories
- [x] **Split & Reconverge** — Paths can split and merge multiple times

**Convergence Flow:**
```
Player 1: [Start A] → [Key Point A1] → [Key Point A2] ──────┐
                                                              ├──→ [Convergence] → [Allied Path] or [Enemy Path]
Player 2: [Start B] → [Key Point B1] → [Key Point B2] ──────┘

Convergence checks:
  - Did Player 1 help the rebels? Did Player 2 join the crown?
  - If opposing factions → Enemy encounter
  - If same faction → Alliance formed
  - If neutral → Negotiation interaction point
```

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_campaign_entry_points` | Multiple starting branches | `campaign_id`, `entry_label`, `start_node_id`, `faction_id`, `description`, `max_players` |
| `rp_convergence_nodes` | Where paths merge | `campaign_id`, `node_id`, `required_entry_points` (JSONB), `convergence_type` (merge/clash/negotiate) |
| `rp_convergence_rules` | How alliances/enemies are decided | `convergence_id`, `condition_type`, `conditions` (JSONB), `result` (ally/enemy/neutral), `target_node_id` |

#### 11. Faction System (Campaign-Level)
Factions within campaigns that players can join, betray, or destroy — affecting the entire story arc.

- [x] **Campaign Factions** — Creators define factions per campaign with lore, goals, and values
- [x] **Faction Joining** — Players join factions through story choices or interaction points
- [x] **Faction Reputation** — Per-player reputation with each faction (-100 to +100)
- [x] **Faction Conflicts** — Factions can be allied, neutral, or at war — affecting player interactions
- [x] **Faction Perks** — High reputation unlocks faction-specific choices, items, abilities
- [x] **Faction Betrayal** — Leaving/betraying a faction has severe consequences
- [x] **Multiplayer Faction Wars** — In convergence, faction alignment determines ally/enemy status
- [x] **Faction Leaderboard** — Track which factions are most popular across all sessions

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_campaign_factions` | Faction definitions per campaign | `campaign_id`, `name`, `description`, `image_url`, `values` (JSONB), `perks` (JSONB) |
| `rp_faction_relations` | Inter-faction relationships | `campaign_id`, `faction_a_id`, `faction_b_id`, `relation_type` (allied/neutral/hostile) |
| `rp_character_faction_standing` | Player's faction reputation | `session_id`, `character_id`, `faction_id`, `reputation_score`, `joined_at`, `betrayed_at` |

- [x] Alliance/Enemy resolution engine
- [x] Convergence reveal UI
- [x] Faction system with reputation tracking
- [x] Faction conflicts affecting multiplayer dynamics

#### 12. Player-to-Player Physical Interaction System
Real-time physical and social interactions between players when they meet in multiplayer campaigns — proximity-based, skill-gated, and inventory-dependent.

##### Proximity Mechanics
- [x] **Proximity Tracking** — Track relative distance between players in a scene (close/mid/far)
- [x] **Movement Actions** — Players can: stop, walk, run, approach a specific player, retreat, circle around
- [x] **Proximity Zones** — Actions unlock based on distance:
  - **Far** (10+ paces): Shout, signal, observe
  - **Mid** (3-9 paces): Speak normally, gesture, throw item
  - **Close** (1-2 paces): Whisper, hand item, grab, shove
  - **Adjacent** (touching): Stab, pickpocket, embrace, restrain

##### Physical Actions (Proximity + Inventory + Skill Gated)
- [ ] **Melee Actions** — Stab, slash, punch, shove (requires: adjacent + weapon in inventory + combat skill)
- [ ] **Stealth Actions** — Stab from behind, pickpocket, plant item (requires: adjacent + stealth skill + concealed item)
- [ ] **Social Actions** — Whisper, lie, persuade, intimidate, bargain (requires: close/adjacent + charisma/wisdom checks)
- [ ] **Ranged Actions** — Throw item, shoot bow, cast spell (requires: mid+ range + item/ability)
- [ ] **Movement Actions** — Walk closer, run away, block path, follow silently

**Action Availability Logic:**
```
Can player A "stab" player B?
  ├─ Is A adjacent to B? ✗ → Action hidden
  ├─ Does A have a bladed weapon in inventory? ✗ → Action hidden
  ├─ Has A prepared the weapon (unsheathed/unhidden)? ✗ → Action hidden
  ├─ Does A have sufficient combat/stealth stat? ✗ → Action visible but grayed out
  └─ All pass → Action available (with stat check roll on execution)
```

##### Pre-Planning & Preparation
- [ ] **Action Preparation** — Players must prepare actions in advance (hidden from others):
  - "Hide knife in cloak" → Conceals weapon, enables surprise attacks later
  - "Ready bow" → Enables ranged attack next turn but visible to perceptive players
  - "Prepare lie" → Pre-write a deceptive statement for upcoming conversation
  - "Signal ally" → Set up a secret signal with another player
- [ ] **Preparation Slots** — Limited number of preparations based on level/wisdom
- [ ] **Preparation Reveal** — Preparations only revealed when used or detected by perception
- [ ] **Preparation Cooldowns** — Can't re-prepare immediately after use

##### Awareness & Perception System
- [ ] **Passive Perception** — Auto-calculated from wisdom + agility + level
- [ ] **Perception Checks** — Automatic rolls when nearby players prepare/execute hidden actions
- [ ] **Awareness Levels:**
  - **Oblivious** (low perception): No warnings, easily surprised
  - **Alert** (mid perception): "You sense something is off" hints
  - **Vigilant** (high perception): "Player X reached into their cloak" — partial reveal
  - **Hawkeye** (max perception): Full action detection — "Player X concealed a dagger"
- [ ] **Perception Modifiers** — Environment (dark = harder), fatigue, distraction, magic
- [ ] **Detection Notifications** — Private alerts to perceptive players about suspicious actions
- [ ] **Counter-Actions** — If you detect a threat, unlock reactive options (dodge, block, call out, counter-attack)

##### Action Resolution
- [ ] **Stat Check Rolls** — Actions resolved via stat checks (attacker stat vs defender stat)
- [ ] **Surprise Bonus** — Undetected actions get +3 to stat check
- [ ] **Consequence Engine** — Each action has success/fail outcomes defined by campaign creator
- [ ] **Witness System** — Other nearby players may witness actions and gain knowledge/flags
- [ ] **Reputation Impact** — Aggressive actions affect faction standing and NPC relationships
- [ ] **Death/Injury from PvP** — Stab can wound or kill based on damage system (creator-configured lethality)

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_player_positions` | Player proximity in scene | `session_id`, `character_id`, `zone` (far/mid/close/adjacent), `relative_to_character_id`, `updated_at` |
| `rp_prepared_actions` | Pre-planned hidden actions | `session_id`, `character_id`, `action_type`, `target_character_id`, `item_id`, `preparation` (JSONB), `is_revealed`, `prepared_at` |
| `rp_action_log` | All executed actions | `session_id`, `actor_id`, `target_id`, `action_type`, `stat_check_result`, `was_detected`, `outcome` (JSONB), `witnesses` (JSONB), `executed_at` |
| `rp_perception_events` | Detection alerts | `session_id`, `observer_id`, `target_id`, `perception_roll`, `detection_level` (oblivious/alert/vigilant/hawkeye), `message`, `created_at` |

**Action Categories & Requirements:**
| Action | Range | Requires Item? | Requires Skill? | Detectable? |
|--------|-------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Stab | Adjacent | Bladed weapon | Combat ≥ 3 | Perception vs Stealth |
| Stab from behind | Adjacent | Concealed blade | Stealth ≥ 5 | Perception vs Stealth+2 |
| Whisper | Close | No | — | Perception ≥ 7 to overhear |
| Lie | Close/Mid | No | Charisma ≥ 4 | Wisdom vs Charisma |
| Scream/Shout | Any | No | — | Always detected |
| Pickpocket | Adjacent | No | Agility ≥ 6 | Perception vs Agility |
| Throw item | Mid+ | Throwable item | Agility ≥ 3 | Always visible |
| Block path | Close | No | Strength ≥ 4 | Always visible |
| Follow silently | Mid | No | Stealth ≥ 5 | Perception vs Stealth |
| Hide item on person | Self | Item | Stealth ≥ 3 | Not until used |
| Signal ally | Far+ | No | — | Perception ≥ 5 |

##### Creator Tools for PvP Interactions
- [x] **Interaction Zone Editor** — Define which scenes allow PvP interactions
- [x] **Lethality Settings** — Per-campaign: no-kill, wound-only, permadeath
- [ ] **Custom Action Builder** — Creators add campaign-specific actions with custom requirements
- [ ] **Consequence Templates** — Pre-built outcomes (wound, betray, ally, escape) creators can assign
- [x] **PvP Toggle** — Campaign-level setting to enable/disable player-vs-player actions

---

#### 13. Suggestion & Hint System
A dynamic hint system that nudges players toward interesting paths — whether they follow or ignore hints affects the campaign trajectory and can trigger random events.

##### Hint Mechanics
- [ ] **Context-Aware Suggestions** — System analyzes player state (stats, inventory, flags, position) and suggests relevant actions
- [ ] **Hint Types:**
  - 🧭 **Direction hints** — "The eastern path seems less traveled..." (navigation)
  - ⚔️ **Action hints** — "Your blade could serve you well here..." (combat/stealth)
  - 🗣️ **Social hints** — "Perhaps diplomacy would yield better results..." (persuasion)
  - 🔍 **Discovery hints** — "Something glints in the corner of your eye..." (exploration)
  - ⚠️ **Warning hints** — "Your instincts tell you to be cautious..." (danger ahead)
- [ ] **Hint Frequency** — Configurable per campaign (frequent/moderate/rare/none)
- [ ] **Hint Accuracy** — Not all hints are helpful — some are traps or misdirection (creator-designed)

##### Player Response & Consequences
- [ ] **Follow Hint** — Player takes the suggested action → triggers "obedient path" outcomes
- [ ] **Ignore Hint** — Player does something else → triggers "defiant path" outcomes
- [ ] **Opposite Action** — Player deliberately does the opposite → triggers special "contrarian" events
- [ ] **Hint Tracking** — Track how often a player follows/ignores hints (affects future hint accuracy)
- [ ] **Hint as Random Event Trigger** — Hint responses serve as triggers for random events:
  - Followed 3 hints in a row → "Guardian Angel" event (bonus)
  - Ignored 3 hints in a row → "Lost Wanderer" event (penalty or surprise)
  - Took opposite action → "Wildcard" random event

##### Creator Hint Designer
- [ ] **Hint Placement** — Attach hints to specific nodes, key points, or interaction zones
- [ ] **Conditional Hints** — Hints only appear if certain conditions are met (stat threshold, item, flag)
- [ ] **Hint Chains** — Sequence of hints that build toward a revelation or trap
- [ ] **Red Herrings** — Deliberately misleading hints to test player judgment
- [ ] **Multiplayer Divergent Hints** — Different players in same session get different/conflicting hints
- [ ] **Hint Source Flavor** — Hints presented as: inner voice, companion whisper, environmental clue, divine sign

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_hints` | Hint definitions per campaign | `campaign_id`, `node_id`, `hint_type`, `hint_text`, `conditions` (JSONB), `follow_outcome` (JSONB), `ignore_outcome` (JSONB), `is_red_herring`, `source_flavor` |
| `rp_hint_responses` | Player reactions to hints | `session_id`, `hint_id`, `character_id`, `response` (followed/ignored/opposite), `triggered_event_id`, `responded_at` |
| `rp_hint_chains` | Linked hint sequences | `campaign_id`, `chain_name`, `hint_ids` (JSONB array), `completion_reward` (JSONB), `chain_order` |

**Hint → Random Event Integration:**
```
Player receives hint: "The shadows whisper of danger ahead..."
  ├─ Follows (takes cautious route) → No ambush, +5 XP, hint streak +1
  ├─ Ignores (walks straight through) → 60% chance ambush random event fires
  └─ Opposite (charges into shadows) → Triggers "Reckless Bravery" event
       ├─ If Strength ≥ 6: Defeat ambushers, +30 XP, rare item drop
       └─ If Strength < 6: Captured, injury, lose item
```

### 🤖 AI Integration — Lore Chronicles Intelligence Layer

A multi-faceted AI system powered by Lovable AI (via edge functions) that enhances every layer of the Lore Chronicles experience — from narrating stories to generating backstories, interpreting free-text player actions, and answering lore questions.

**Core Principle:** The AI is always grounded in existing lore. Every AI-generated response pulls context from almanac data, campaign content, and session history to stay universe-consistent.

**AI Gateway:** All AI calls go through Lovable AI (`https://ai.gateway.lovable.dev/v1/chat/completions`) via dedicated edge functions. Uses `LOVABLE_API_KEY` (auto-provisioned). Default model: `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`.

---

#### AI Feature 1: AI Dungeon Master

The AI acts as a dynamic narrator/DM that generates story prose, NPC dialogue, and scene descriptions based on the campaign's existing nodes, lore, and player state. **Crucially, the campaign creator feeds the AI with lore context and story structure — the AI fills in the narrative gaps between key points.**

##### How It Works
1. **Campaign creator defines** key points, story nodes, NPCs, and world rules as usual
2. **Between authored nodes**, the AI generates transitional narrative based on:
   - The campaign's genre, tone, and world rules
   - The current player's character stats, race, abilities, inventory
   - Session history (past choices, story flags, interaction logs)
   - Almanac lore relevant to the current location/faction/race
   - Creator-defined "DM instructions" (tone guidance, plot constraints, forbidden topics)
3. **AI narrates** scene descriptions, NPC dialogue, ambient events, and consequences
4. **Player choices still drive progression** — AI enhances the journey, doesn't replace authored structure

##### Creator DM Configuration
- [ ] **DM Instructions Field** — Free-text field on campaign settings where creator defines AI behavior:
  - Tone: "dark and foreboding", "lighthearted adventure", "political intrigue"
  - Constraints: "never kill the player outright", "always offer a peaceful option"
  - Lore focus: "emphasize the conflict between the Elder Council and the Shadow Guild"
  - NPC personalities: "Kael is sarcastic but loyal; The Elder speaks in riddles"
- [ ] **AI Narration Toggle** — Per-node option: "AI-narrated transition" vs "direct jump to next node"
- [ ] **Lore Context Injection** — Creator selects which almanac entries the AI should reference for this campaign
- [ ] **NPC Voice Profiles** — Define speaking style per NPC (formal, casual, cryptic, aggressive)
- [ ] **Guardrails** — Creator sets hard limits: no romance, no real-world references, PG-13 only, etc.

##### Technical Implementation
- [ ] **Edge Function: `ai-dungeon-master`**
  - Input: `{ session_id, character_id, current_node_id, action_context }`
  - Fetches: campaign data, character stats, session flags, recent history, relevant almanac entries
  - System prompt built dynamically from creator's DM instructions + lore context
  - Output: `{ narration: string, npc_dialogue?: { name, text }[], suggested_choices?: string[], stat_effects?: object }`
  - Streaming response for immersive text reveal
- [ ] **Context Window Management** — Summarize older session history to fit context limits; keep last 10 interactions verbatim
- [ ] **Lore Retrieval** — Query almanac tables (characters, locations, races, relics) for relevant context based on current campaign tags/references
- [ ] **Response Caching** — Cache deterministic narrations (same node + same flags = same narration) to reduce API calls

##### Database Addition
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_campaign_ai_config` | AI settings per campaign | `campaign_id`, `dm_instructions` (TEXT), `tone`, `guardrails` (JSONB), `lore_context_ids` (JSONB array of almanac entry IDs), `npc_voice_profiles` (JSONB), `ai_enabled` (BOOLEAN) |
| `rp_ai_narration_log` | Log of all AI-generated narrations | `session_id`, `character_id`, `node_id`, `prompt_hash`, `narration_text`, `model_used`, `tokens_used`, `created_at` |

##### UI Integration
- [ ] **Narration Panel** — AI text appears in a styled "narrator voice" panel with typewriter animation
- [ ] **NPC Dialogue Bubbles** — AI-generated NPC speech displayed with portrait + speech bubble
- [ ] **AI Transition Screens** — Between key points, show AI-narrated scene with atmospheric styling
- [ ] **DM Config Panel** — In campaign editor, a dedicated "AI Dungeon Master" settings tab

---

#### AI Feature 2: Free-Text Response Interpreter

Players type free-form actions ("I try to pick the lock", "I intimidate the guard", "I search the room for hidden compartments") and the AI interprets them in context, resolving outcomes based on character stats and story state.

##### How It Works
1. Player reaches a node with free-text input enabled (existing `FreeTextInput` component)
2. Player types their action
3. AI receives: the action text, character stats, current node context, available story flags
4. AI determines:
   - Which stat check applies (if any)
   - Whether the action succeeds or fails
   - Narrative outcome description
   - Any stat/flag/inventory changes
   - Which node to transition to next (if applicable)

##### Implementation Details
- [ ] **Edge Function: `ai-interpret-action`**
  - Input: `{ session_id, character_id, node_id, player_text, campaign_ai_config }`
  - System prompt includes: current scene description, character sheet, available exits/choices, DM instructions
  - Uses tool calling to return structured output:
    ```json
    {
      "interpretation": "You attempt to pick the lock...",
      "stat_check": { "stat": "agility", "difficulty": 5, "result": "pass" },
      "outcome_narration": "The lock clicks open with a satisfying snap...",
      "stat_effects": { "agility": 1 },
      "flag_effects": { "lockpicked_cell": true },
      "next_node_id": "uuid-or-null",
      "xp_reward": 15
    }
    ```
  - If no matching authored node exists, AI generates a mini-narrative and returns player to the nearest authored node
- [ ] **Stat Check Resolution** — AI picks the relevant stat, rolls against difficulty, narrates pass/fail
- [ ] **Action Validation** — AI rejects impossible actions ("I fly to the moon") with in-character responses
- [ ] **Memory Integration** — AI remembers past free-text actions within the session for continuity
- [ ] **Creator Opt-In** — Free-text input only available on nodes where the creator enables it

##### UI Changes
- [ ] **Enhanced FreeTextInput** — Add loading state with "The DM considers your action..." animation
- [ ] **Outcome Display** — Show stat check roll visualization (dice animation), then narration
- [ ] **Action History** — Scrollable log of past free-text actions and their outcomes in the session

---

#### AI Feature 3: AI Lore Q&A Assistant

A chat-based assistant that answers player questions about the ThouArt universe using almanac data as context. Available as a sidebar panel during gameplay or as a standalone page.

##### How It Works
1. Player asks a question: "Who is the Elder of the Northern Council?" / "What powers do the Shadowkin have?"
2. AI searches relevant almanac entries (characters, locations, races, relics, lore articles)
3. AI responds with lore-accurate information, citing sources
4. Maintains conversation history for follow-up questions

##### Implementation Details
- [ ] **Edge Function: `ai-lore-assistant`**
  - Input: `{ messages: Message[], user_id }`
  - Pre-processes: searches almanac tables for relevant entries using keyword matching
  - Injects matched almanac entries into system prompt as context
  - System prompt: "You are the Keeper of Lore for the ThouArt universe. Answer questions using ONLY the provided lore entries. If the answer isn't in the provided lore, say so. Cite your sources."
  - Streaming response for conversational feel
- [ ] **Almanac Search** — Full-text search across `almanac_characters`, `almanac_locations`, `almanac_races`, `almanac_relics` for relevant context
- [ ] **Source Citations** — AI references which almanac entry each fact comes from, with links
- [ ] **Conversation Memory** — Store conversation per user (last N messages) for context continuity
- [ ] **Spoiler Guard** — If player is mid-campaign, AI avoids spoiling unreached story content

##### Database Addition
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_lore_conversations` | Chat history per user | `user_id`, `messages` (JSONB array), `last_active_at`, `created_at` |

##### UI Components
- [ ] **LoreAssistant Panel** — Slide-out sidebar with chat interface, available from Lore Chronicles and Almanac pages
- [ ] **Inline Lore Tooltips** — During gameplay, highlighted lore terms open a quick AI-powered explanation popup
- [ ] **"Ask the Keeper" Button** — Floating action button on relevant pages

---

#### AI Feature 4: AI Character Backstory Generator

Generate rich, lore-consistent character backstories based on the player's chosen race, stats, and optional prompts. Helps players who struggle with creative writing create compelling characters.

##### How It Works
1. During character creation (Step 3: Backstory), player can click "Generate Backstory"
2. AI receives: selected race (with lore), allocated stats, optional player prompt ("I want my character to be a disgraced noble")
3. AI generates a 2-3 paragraph backstory that:
   - References the character's race and its lore
   - Explains how their stats developed (high strength = trained warrior, high magic = studied at academy)
   - Incorporates the player's optional prompt
   - References real locations/factions from the almanac
4. Player can regenerate, edit, or use as-is

##### Implementation Details
- [ ] **Edge Function: `ai-generate-backstory`**
  - Input: `{ race_id, race_lore, stats, player_prompt?, existing_backstory? }`
  - Fetches race data from `almanac_races` for lore context
  - Optionally fetches related almanac entries (locations, factions) for world grounding
  - System prompt: "Generate a compelling 2-3 paragraph character backstory for a {race_name} in the ThouArt universe. Their stats suggest: {stat_interpretation}. Use the following world lore for grounding: {lore_context}. {player_prompt}"
  - Non-streaming (returns complete backstory)
  - Uses tool calling for structured output: `{ backstory: string, suggested_name?: string }`
- [ ] **Stat Interpretation** — Map stats to narrative hooks:
  - High Strength → warrior, laborer, gladiator background
  - High Magic → academy student, wild mage, cursed bloodline
  - High Charisma → diplomat, merchant, performer, cult leader
  - High Wisdom → hermit, scholar, elder's apprentice
  - High Agility → thief, scout, acrobat, hunter
- [ ] **Regenerate with Tweaks** — Player can say "make it darker" or "add a lost sibling" and AI refines
- [ ] **"Inspire Me" Mode** — Generate 3 short backstory hooks (one-liners) for player to choose from before full generation

##### UI Integration
- [ ] **"Generate Backstory" Button** — In CharacterCreator Step 3, next to the backstory textarea
- [ ] **Generation Modal** — Shows loading spinner, then displays generated backstory with "Use This" / "Regenerate" / "Edit" buttons
- [ ] **Prompt Input** — Optional text field: "Any preferences? (e.g., 'exiled warrior', 'orphan mage')"
- [ ] **Backstory Preview** — Styled preview card showing the generated backstory before confirming

#### 14. Campaign Universe Mode — Original vs ThouArt Variation
Creators choose whether their campaign uses the official ThouArt universe rules or an entirely original custom world system.

##### Universe Mode Selection (Campaign Creation)
- [ ] **Universe Toggle** — "ThouArt Variation" or "Original Universe" selected at campaign creation
- [ ] **ThouArt Variation Mode:**
  - Uses existing `almanac_races`, `almanac_magic`, factions, relics, etc.
  - Stat system follows standard ThouArt rules
  - Lore references auto-link to the Witness Almanac
  - Community lore entries also available
- [ ] **Original Universe Mode:**
  - Creator defines **everything** from scratch
  - Custom races, magic systems, beliefs, factions, physics, rules
  - No cross-references to ThouArt almanac
  - Fully self-contained universe

##### Custom World Builder (Original Mode)
- [ ] **Custom Races** — Name, description, stat bonuses, lore, portrait
- [ ] **Custom Magic Systems** — Define magic types, casting rules, costs, effects
- [ ] **Custom Beliefs/Religions** — Deity pantheons, rituals, divine powers, alignment effects
- [ ] **Custom Factions** — Organizations with goals, ranks, perks, conflicts
- [ ] **Custom Items & Weapons** — Define unique weapons, armor, consumables, artifacts
- [ ] **Custom Stat Systems** — Override default stats (rename, add, remove stat categories)
- [ ] **World Rules Document** — Free-text world bible that players see before joining
- [ ] **Custom Titles & Ranks** — Rank hierarchies unique to the universe

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_campaign_universe` | Universe settings per campaign | `campaign_id`, `mode` (thouart/original), `world_name`, `world_description`, `rules_document`, `custom_stats` (JSONB) |
| `rp_custom_races` | Creator-defined races | `campaign_id`, `name`, `description`, `stat_bonuses` (JSONB), `image_url`, `lore` |

---

#### 15. Interaction Points — Relationship-Driven Events & Hidden Combat
Interaction Points (IP) between players accumulate from all interactions and **dynamically unlock situations, events, and forced choices**.

##### Interaction Point Accumulation
- [ ] **Auto-Calculated IP** — Every interaction between two characters adjusts their IP score:
  - Helped in combat → +15 IP
  - Shared item → +10 IP
  - Lied successfully → -5 IP (if discovered later: -20 IP)
  - Stole from → -25 IP
  - Saved their life → +30 IP
  - Betrayed → -50 IP
  - Whispered secret → +5 to +15 IP depending on value
- [ ] **IP Thresholds** — Crossing thresholds triggers creator-defined events:
  - **-75 to -100: Blood Feud** → Forced confrontation event
  - **-50 to -74: Hostile** → "Kill or be killed" scenarios become available
  - **-25 to -49: Distrustful** → Perception bonus against them, limited cooperation
  - **-24 to +24: Neutral** → Standard interactions
  - **+25 to +49: Friendly** → Share hints, cooperative bonuses
  - **+50 to +74: Bonded** → Unlock duo abilities, shared quests
  - **+75 to +100: Sworn** → Sacrifice events, combined stat checks, unbreakable alliance mechanics

##### IP-Triggered Scenarios
- [ ] **Forced Choice Events** — When IP is deeply negative, creator can trigger:
  - "Choose who lives" — pick between two characters to save
  - "Duel to the death" — mandatory PvP with no escape
  - "Betray your ally or lose everything" — faction loyalty vs personal bond
- [ ] **Alliance Events** — When IP is highly positive:
  - "Combined strength" — merge stat checks for powerful joint actions
  - "Shield wall" — one player can absorb damage for the other
  - "Shared vision" — see each other's hints temporarily
- [ ] **IP-Based Path Unlocks** — Certain story branches only available at specific IP thresholds

##### Hidden Combat & Fog of War
- [ ] **Hidden Stats in Combat** — Players do NOT see each other's ability scores during encounters
- [ ] **Blind Decisions** — Must judge opponents based on:
  - Visible equipment (armor, weapons)
  - Prior interactions (did they seem strong?)
  - Reputation/rumors from NPCs
  - Their own perception skill
- [ ] **Bluff System** — Players can bluff their strength:
  - "Flex" action → Charisma check to appear stronger than you are
  - "Feign weakness" → Stealth check to appear weaker (lure into trap)
- [ ] **Combat Reveal** — Stats only revealed after combat resolves (post-fight summary)
- [ ] **Scouting** — Spend a turn to attempt perception check → partial stat reveal ("They seem agile but frail")

##### Free-Text Input → Dynamic Skill Calculation
- [ ] **Open Input Actions** — Players can type custom actions instead of choosing from a list
- [ ] **Action Parsing Engine** — System analyzes free-text input and calculates:
  - Which stat(s) are required (e.g., "I try to climb the wall" → Agility + Strength)
  - Difficulty rating based on context
  - Required items (e.g., "I pick the lock" → needs lockpick in inventory)
  - IP adjustment if targeting another player
- [ ] **Interaction Input** — When interacting with another player via free text:
  - "I compliment their armor" → Charisma check, +3 IP if passed
  - "I secretly pocket their coin purse" → Agility + Stealth check, -25 IP if caught
  - "I offer to share my food" → No check, +5 IP
- [ ] **Creator Overrides** — Campaign creator can pre-define custom input responses for specific scenarios
- [ ] **Fallback Resolution** — If input doesn't match any pattern, default to nearest stat check + narrator description

**Database Addition:**
| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `rp_interaction_points` | IP score between character pairs | `session_id`, `character_a_id`, `character_b_id`, `score`, `last_interaction`, `updated_at` |
| `rp_ip_events` | Events triggered by IP thresholds | `campaign_id`, `threshold_min`, `threshold_max`, `event_type`, `event_payload` (JSONB), `is_mandatory` |
| `rp_ip_history` | Full log of IP changes | `session_id`, `character_a_id`, `character_b_id`, `change`, `reason`, `source_action_id`, `created_at` |
| `rp_free_text_actions` | Player free-text input log | `session_id`, `character_id`, `input_text`, `parsed_stats` (JSONB), `difficulty`, `result`, `ip_change`, `created_at` |
| `rp_combat_encounters` | PvP/PvE combat instances | `session_id`, `participants` (JSONB), `combat_type`, `stats_hidden`, `outcome` (JSONB), `started_at`, `resolved_at` |

**Free-Text → Skill Mapping Examples:**
| Player Input | Parsed Stats | Difficulty | Item Required? |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| "I climb the wall quietly" | Agility + Stealth | Medium | No |
| "I stab him while he sleeps" | Stealth + Combat | Hard | Bladed weapon |
| "I convince the guard to let us pass" | Charisma + Wisdom | Medium | No |
| "I forge a document to enter the city" | Wisdom + Agility | Hard | Paper + Ink |
| "I challenge him to an arm wrestle" | Strength | Easy | No |
| "I pray to the old gods for guidance" | Wisdom + Magic | Varies | Belief alignment |
