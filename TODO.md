## 📋 Development Notes

### Design System

- Use custom hooks for data fetching
- Prefer parallel tool calls for efficiency
- Add staggered animations to lists/grids

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport
- [ ] Verify dark mode appearance
- [ ] Check loading states
- [ ] Validate form submissions
- [ ] Test authenticated vs guest views
- [ ] Test with empty data states
- [ ] Test with slow network (3G throttle)
